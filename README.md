Participated in a family World Cup Pool where each participant selected 6 teams and were rewarded points for how far they progressed in the 2022 FIFA World Cup. I chose to track the progress of everyone in a google sheet, which was updated daily with results. After the tournament concluded, we wanted to make an interactive graph to see how the players did day by day, showing who had an early lead and how the results ended up. The data still needs to be cleaned a bit, but here is the start of the interactive graph. It is shown on the link above.
